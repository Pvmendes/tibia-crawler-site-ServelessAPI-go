# Tibia crawler on official site using servelessAPI in AWS

Inspired by [Tobias Lindberg](https://github.com/tobiasehlert) and his repository [TibiaData](https://github.com/TibiaData/tibiadata-api-go) I'm build this serveless App to upload on Amazon AWS and use as a personal crawler to a official [Tibia website](https://www.tibia.com/news/)
